# Pagination.cfc 2.0

New in 2.0:

- Overall strategy is to allow querying for only the records needed per page
- Add a total recordcount property
- Bring stylesheets in line with Bootstrap's pagination (that's standard enough right?)
- Rewrite getters & setters as implicit methods via properties
- Potentially copy & paste documentation into this markdown file

That's really all I've got. Further suggestions welcome.
